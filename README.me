This project was the creation of a ficticious database using different methods

It began by outlining the orginzation doing things such as constructing a ER diagram as well as a relational schema

Next it was constructing the DDL/DML and creating data to fill in the tables so thar we would have a database that effective queries could be ran on

Lastly it was reconstructed using a python ORM script utlizing the sqlalchemy library again to the point we can also run effective queries
